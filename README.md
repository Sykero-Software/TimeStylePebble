*Left:* two configurable widget columns (here: BTC, ETH, EUR/USD, electricity
price · weather, UV index, sleep, steps), customizable colours. *Middle:* live
**Sykerö Track Work Time** status. *Right:* live **MIDI Recorder** status.

Inspired by the visual language of the Timeline found on the Pebble Time, Sykerö TimeStyle is designed as the “present” to complement the Timeline’s “past” and “future”.

* Readable: With more than 80% of the display area devoted to the time and 6 font options, it's designed for readability in all conditions. Unlike most other Pebble faces, time text is displayed using antialiasing, achieved using palette swapping.
* Colorful: includes over 20 preset color schemes, and also supports custom colors using any color the Pebble Time can display&mdash;also supports saving, loading, and sharing custom presets!
* Configurable: it features a wide variety of different complications, including step counts, sleep times, weather forecasts, the week number, seconds, the time in another time zone, the battery level, and more.
* Keeps you informed: it automatically displays notifications when the battery is low or when your phone disconnects.
* Works in 30 different languages, more than any other Pebble face: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Czech, Slovak, Portuguese, Greek, Swedish, Polish, Romanian, Vietnamese, Catalan, Norwegian, Russian, Estonian, Basque, Finnish, Danish, Lithuanian, Slovenian, Hungarian, Croatian, Serbian, Irish, Latviann, and Ukrainian.

## Track Work Time integration

This fork adds a work-time status strip, fed over PebbleKit Android 2 by the
[trackworktime](https://github.com/Sykero-Software/trackworktime) Android app. To
control tracking from the wrist (pick a task, start/stop), pair it with the
companion watchapp
[Sykerö Track Work Time](https://github.com/Sykero-Software/PebbleTrackWorkTime).

## Analog clock face

TimeStyle can show an **analog clock** in place of the digital time, taking the
same central area (config → *Clock → Clock style → Analog*); the 12 hour marks
are toggleable via *Analog hour marks*.

The analog face (bold geometric hands, hour ticks and centre pivot) is **ported
from the [Nyquist watchface](https://github.com/truhanen/pebble-nyquist-watchface)
by truhanen**, used under the GPL-3.0 license. Many thanks to truhanen for the
original design.
